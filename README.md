# Kentik Ansible Collection
This is an Ansible Collection for managing your device settings within the Kentik platform using the REST API. This collection is undergoing active development, but everything in the main branch should be ready for use.

The goal of this repository will be to offer prebuilt Ansible modules, playbooks, and roles that can be immediatley valuable to Kentik users.
